    <p>A Google engineer has been fired following the release of a now-infamous<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-engineer-anti-diversity-manifesto-causes-uproar-2017-8">manifesto against diversity</a>. The engineer<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/google-fires-employee-behind-controversial-diversity-memo?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">confirmed to Bloomberg</a>he was fired Monday. His manifesto caused tremendous shockwaves across Google and the larger tech industry.</p>
<p>A source confirmed the firing, but a Google spokesperson declined to comment on personnel matters.</p>
<p>The news of the engineer’s firing comes shortly after<a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/8/7/16110696/firing-google-ceo-employee-penned-controversial-memo-on-women-has-violated-its-code-of-conduct">Recode reported</a>on a company-wide memo from Google CEO Sundar Pichai, which indicated that portions of the manifesto might violate the company’s code of conduct. A Google spokesperson confirmed the Pichai memo’s authenticity.</p>
<p>Specifically, Pichai objects to the author’s claims that biological differences make women less well-suited for careers in tech. Pichai suggests that this portion of the manifesto was “not OK,” and that it went too far“by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.”</p>
<p>“To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK,” Pichai wrote.</p>
<p>The ten-page manifesto first became public knowledge on Saturday, following a report from<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzbm4a/employees-anti-diversity-manifesto-goes-internally-viral-at-google">Vice’s Motherboard</a>. A full copy of the manifesto was<a href="http://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320">released by Gizmodo later that day</a>. </p>
<p>In the manifesto, titled “Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber,” the engineer argued that the search giant needs to be more tolerant of conservative viewpoints amongst its employees. In his memo, Pichai agreed with that particular point, and says that the company could be more inclusive of different perspectives.</p>
<p>You can read Pichai’s full memo here:</p>
<p>Subject: Our words matter</p>
<p>This has been a very difficult few days. I wanted to provide an update on the memo that was circulated over this past week.</p>
<p>First, let me say that we strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves, and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate, regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it. However, portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace. Our job is to build great products for users that make a difference in their lives. To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK. It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct, which expects “each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination.”</p>
<p>The memo has clearly impacted our co-workers, some of whom are hurting and feel judged based on their gender. Our co-workers shouldn’t have to worry that each time they open their mouths to speak in a meeting, they have to prove that they are not like the memo states, being “agreeable” rather than “assertive,” showing a “lower stress tolerance,” or being “neurotic.”</p>
<p>At the same time, there are co-workers who are questioning whether they can safely express their views in the workplace (especially those with a minority viewpoint). They too feel under threat, and that is also not OK. People must feel free to express dissent. So to be clear again, many points raised in the memo — such as the portions criticizing Google’s trainings, questioning the role of ideology in the workplace, and debating whether programs for women and underserved groups are sufficiently open to all — are important topics. The author had a right to express their views on those topics — we encourage an environment in which people can do this and it remains our policy to not take action against anyone for prompting these discussions.</p>
<p>The past few days have been very difficult for many at the company, and we need to find a way to debate issues on which we might disagree — while doing so in line with our Code of Conduct. I’d encourage each of you to make an effort over the coming days to reach out to those who might have different perspectives from your own. I will be doing the same.</p>
<p>I have been on work related travel in Africa and Europe the past couple of weeks and had just started my family vacation here this week. I have decided to return tomorrow as clearly there’s a lot more to discuss as a group — including how we create a more inclusive environment for all.</p>
<p>So please join me, along with members of the leadership team at a town hall on Thursday. Check your calendar soon for details.</p>
<p>— Sundar</p>
