Even better, a smartphone app connects your phone to the camera and lets you download and share your shots over Wi-Fi.

The newest addition to the company lineup, the MA770, is a 35-pound speaker made of concrete (yes, cement and crushed rocks) that is equal parts art and audio. It looks looks like brutalist architecture sculpted in a wind tunnel by an origami artist. The sound quality isn’t overshadowed by the aesthetic, though—the MA770 has legit hi-fi chops. Just don’t plan on toting it from room to room. There are anvils lighter than this.Read the review here.</p>

<h2 id="Specialized-Turbo-Vado-6-0"><a href="#Specialized-Turbo-Vado-6-0" class="headerlink" title="Specialized Turbo Vado 6.0"></a>Specialized Turbo Vado 6.0</h2><p>Think of the Turbo Vado 6.0 as the love child of a shrunken Vespa and an overweight 1967 Schwinn Typhoon. The waterproof alloy frame has a gently sloping step-through top tube, making it easy to wear a skirt while riding. A removable 604-watt-hour battery pack seamlessly integrates into the down tube, and the belt-driven 350-watt motor sits hidden in the bottom bracket. After a full charge that takes 4 hours and 20 minutes, the bike is ready to roll. Choose between three modes—Eco, Sport, and Turbo—for varying levels of power. Riding uphill in Eco mode can be a killer quad workout, but flip to Turbo mode and it becomes a Mary Poppins joyride.Read the review here.</p>

At 3.1 pounds, the X1 Yoga is a bit beefy but still quite usable. On the other hand, the price tag, at $1,709, is decidedly hard to swallow.<a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/07/review-lenovo-x1-yoga-gen-2/">Read the full review here</a>.</p>

The hot water travels out of the reservoir and rains on the grounds in scheduled intervals, including an initial pour specifically designed to create a bloom, similar to the pour-over method used by baristas at fancy coffee shops. Pair it with the Conical Burr Coffee Grinder With Integrated Scale and you’ve got a damn good cup of coffee.Read the review here.</p>

Just sort through your sky-high digital photo pile using Google’s AI search chops, pick 20 photos you want to feature (or add more for additional cost), order them however you like, slap a name on the front, and it’ll be on your doorstep in two weeks. A 20-page softcover costs you $10 with 35-cents per extra page, while hardcover runs $20, with extras comping in at 65-cents a shot. You get a little more than you pay for, but remember that you’re not paying much.Read the review here.</p>

Meizu has an unorthodox solution to this screen addiction: add another screen, this time to the back of the phone. The Pro 7 comes with a 2-inch rectangular touchscreen across the back left side of the phone, which displays things like the weather, messages, email, fitness activity, and alarms. It also serves as a handy viewfinder for snapping selfies with the outward facing camera. The idea? Making information glance-able will ultimately lead to less dependence on our gadgets. Maybe.Read the story here.</p>

<h2 id="Humanscale"><a href="#Humanscale" class="headerlink" title="Humanscale"></a>Humanscale</h2><p>During the 70s and 80s, designers relied on an analog tool to help them design products for humans. This tool, called Humanscale, was a set of nine rotating disks filled with more than 60,000 data points. Spin the selector in any direction and a series of numbers align in the windows to show you the correct measurement values for the subject you happened to be designing for—things like average height, arm span, sitting hip width, and viewing angle from a desk. MIT Press stopped printing the disks in the mid 1980s, but now, a team is reviving the classic design tool with reprints selling for $79 each or $199 for the complete set.Read the story here.</p>

The Trident is tethered, but that lifeline leading up to the surface is necessary, since radio waves don’t play well in water—plus, if the drone runs out of juice, you can just reel it in.

<h2 id="Nike-Fe-Nom"><a href="#Nike-Fe-Nom" class="headerlink" title="Nike Fe/Nom"></a>Nike Fe/Nom</h2><p>Nike’s newest sports bra, the Fe/Nom, consists of two pieces of fabric stitched together. The secret? It’s made from Flyknit, the material best known for Nike’s kicks. The bra includes six different weaving zones; the tightest stitch is reserved for the underband, which carries most of the load, while the back uses a more open stitch to create greater flexibility and ventilation. A knit fabric might seem like an unlikely material to keep that damage at bay, but Flyknit offers a surprising amount of support—and not in the I’ve-strapped-duct-tape-to-my-chest kind of way.Read the story here.</p>

<h2 id="Stromer-ST1-X"><a href="#Stromer-ST1-X" class="headerlink" title="Stromer ST1 X"></a>Stromer ST1 X</h2><p>Perhaps you dream of being an S-pedelic commuter: sleeping late, zipping to the office, and arriving with time to spare, your freshly pressed Thomas Pink unsullied by pit stains. If so, get a Stromer e-bike. Like many fashionable e-bike brands, Stromer is not for bargain hunters—but its newest addition, the ST1 X, is almost as good as the flagship and far more affordable. The ST1 X boasts top shelf e-bike features like regenerative braking, a large lithium-ion battery, and a purpose built 6061 aluminum frame. Plus, it’s smart! The bike’s performance is tuned using a proprietary algorithm, which can be customized. Stromer can ping it to apply free firmware updates on the fly.<a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/07/review-stromer-st1-x/">Read the full review here</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps you dream of being an S-pedelic commuter: sleeping late, zipping to the office, and arriving with time to spare, your freshly pressed Thomas Pink unsullied by pit stains. If so, get a Stromer e-bike. Like many fashionable e-bike brands, Stromer is not for bargain hunters—but its newest addition, the ST1 X, is almost as good as the flagship and far more affordable. The ST1 X boasts top shelf e-bike features like regenerative braking, a large lithium-ion battery, and a purpose built 6061 aluminum frame. Plus, it’s smart! The bike’s performance is tuned using a proprietary algorithm, which can be customized. Stromer can ping it to apply free firmware updates on the fly.<a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/07/review-stromer-st1-x/">Read the full review here</a>.</p>

Look no further than the Cue, a 1600-watt induction burner that looks like a miniaturized Roomba. A custom 11-inch fry pan with temperature sensors in the base and a tiny circuit board in the handle sits on top. The pan-and-burner combo pair to an app, which provides step-by-step guidance through tested recipes. Want that steak rare? Just tell the app, and it’ll help you nail the internal temperature while browning the outside just right.Read the review here.</p>

<h2 id="Mighty"><a href="#Mighty" class="headerlink" title="Mighty"></a>Mighty</h2><p>Mighty works like an iPod Shuffle, but for Spotify. Choose a few Spotify playlists to sync onto the device (Mighty can hold about 1,000 songs) and then you are free to roam the planet to the soundtrack of your choosing, freed from the shackle of your phone. Use it while working out, walking the dog, or driving, and you’ll find you can flip through music with fewer distractions and more tactile controls. It’s not perfect, but Mighty’s definitely on to something here. Plus, this won’t be the last Spotify-powered gadget you’ll see in the coming years.Read the story here.</p>
