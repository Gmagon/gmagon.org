The Licensor will not assist Licensee in making this determination, nor can the Licensor provide Licensee with legal advice as to intellectual property rights or privacy laws.</p>

If, on the other hand, Licensee or Licensee’s attorney determines it is permissible to proceed and include End-user Generated Content from the Licensed Software, the Licensor asks Licensee to correctly designate the Licensor trademark(s) when referring to the Licensed software in the notice or copyright portion of Licensee’s paper, project, or product.
